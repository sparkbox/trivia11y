# Pursuit of Trivia

A site for questions and answers, either for studying or fun (or both).

## Getting Started

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and `npm` (included with Node.js) to build the site and run it in local development. The LTS (Long Term Support) version is recommended for most cases.

Here are the main commands you'll need to run to get the project up and running.

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the site in development mode
npm start

# build the site for production
npm run build

# lint your code for possible issues
npm run lint

# run unit tests (by default does nothing)
npm run test

# update dependencies to their latest versions
npm run update-deps
```
